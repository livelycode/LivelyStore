#LivelyStore
A git-inspired content tracker written as a C library.  
I wanted to have lightweight library to track and sync data in mobile apps.  
This implementation was abandoned in favor of [synclib (Node.js based)](https://github.com/mirkok/synclib). A port of synclib back to C or Objective-C will follow.

##Features
